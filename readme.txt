== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add options to the select menu =

In the Input Type column, choose Select from the dropdown menu. Then add the options as you want your customers to see them at checkout in the Select Options box directly below the menu. Enter one option per line. Do NOT use commas to separate your options.

= Why would I want to have an extra field at checkout? =
